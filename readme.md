!!! BETA Version !!!

This is a branch of tomojitakasu's RTKLIB with GUIs ported from VCL to Qt5. It is developed using Qt Creator and tested with:
- Windows + mingw
- Linux + gcc

Due to Qt's cross platform approach porting to further OS like MacOS should be easy.

This branch includes also the latest version of septentrio receiver support.
